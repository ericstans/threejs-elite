A few higher‑level patterns & leverage points:

1. Architecture convergence  
- You’re halfway between ad‑hoc object soup and a lightweight ECS. Formalizing components (Position, Velocity, Renderable, RadarSignature, Dockable) would simplify update flows and targeting.  
- A thin event bus (pub/sub) for UI <-> systems (TARGET_CHANGED, DOCK_STATE, SECTOR_LOADED) would remove many implicit flag checks.

2. Determinism & serialization  
- You have hierarchical seeding; extend with a versioned “generation manifest” per sector so changes to algorithms don’t silently reshuffle existing worlds.  
- Snapshot diffing (hash entity archetype + seed + mutable state) can keep save files tiny.

3. Performance headroom  
- Radar & targeting recompute dot products every frame for all objects. Batch a world-space array of entity vectors once per frame; reuse for radar, AI, and proximity alerts.  
- Frustum / distance culling for expensive mesh updates (asteroids, distant stations) will delay needing worker threads.

4. UI cohesion  
- DOM string styling is verbose; a tiny style map + applyStyle(el, token) or a CSS module would declutter logic.  
- Consider a single `uiState` object diffed to DOM (poor man’s virtual UI) to avoid mutation scattering.

5. Spatial & navigation depth  
- Introduce “nav layers”: local (orbit), regional (sector), and jump (inter‑sector). Radar could context‑switch modes (different scaling, filtering).  
- Add inertial dampening feedback (vector arrow showing residual velocity vs facing).

6. Audio & music system  
~~- Pre-schedule MIDI events via Web Audio clock for tighter timing vs per-frame dispatch.  ~~
- Adaptive layering: seed-based motif + sector “mood tags” (cold, hostile, bustling) blending instrument sets from soundfonts.

7. Combat & AI hooks  
- Threat scoring (distance weight * relative velocity * alignment hostility) can drive both radar highlight intensity and NPC alert states.  
- Predictive lead reticle: simple constant-velocity intercept math using relative position & velocity if projectile speed known.

8. Extensibility safeguards  
- Central “entity registry” with incremental numeric IDs + type tags; everywhere else store IDs not references. Helps serialization, replay, network potential.  
- Freeze config objects (Object.freeze) for sector definitions to catch accidental runtime mutation.

~~9. Visual polish quick wins~~  
~~- Add subtle parallax / sway to cockpit bitmap tied to ship roll & pitch (clamped) for motion feel.  ~~
~~- Low-cost starfield depth: two layered cubes with differing scroll factors + slight chromatic aberration shader pass.~~

10. Risk areas / debt  
- Duplicated UI construction logic earlier (now partly cleaned) suggests adding a construction test or build-time linter for accidental duplicate instantiation.  
- Mixed direct DOM + game logic will make refactors harder—start isolating pure calculation functions (e.g., radar projection) into `util/`.
