## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd threejs-elite

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Local SoundFonts
To include a subset of SoundFonts locally (avoid first-play network latency), run:
```bash
node scripts/fetch-soundfonts.js
```
This downloads selected FluidR3_GM instrument JS files into `public/soundfonts`. Only instruments used in the midi files are included.
